**Image Placeholder** inserts placeholder images provided by Lorem Picsum, LoremFlickr and (most importantly) placekitten with the command palette.

## Usage

<!--
üéà If users will interact with your extension manually, describe those options:
-->

To run Image Placeholder:

- Select the **Editor ‚Üí Image Placeholder** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `placeholder` and select the service and type of placeholder you want.

Image placeholder supports three image providers(more planned) and has various options for each.

You can provide dimensions as either `w h`, `w,h` or `w/h` LoremFlickr also supports categories, so you can write something like `600 400 monkey` press <kbd>‚Æê</kbd> and get this image:

_Isn't that a lovely picture eh?_

Both Lorem picusum and LoremFlickr support **random** commands, which adds a random seed string ensuring images of the same dimension will return different images, both of these are pictures of a horse, using the Lorem Flicker placeholder random command and typing `100 horse`
